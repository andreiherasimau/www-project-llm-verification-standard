The Large Language Model Security Verification Standard is built upon the initial research performed into LLM security by the Snyk Security labs team in 2023. Much of the concept, structure, boilerplate and tooling for the LLMSVS has been adapted from the OWASP ASVS project. Thank you to all those previously involved in the OWASP ASVS.
